# Dimensionality-Reduction
This code contains implementations of various dimensionality reduciton methods.
The methods implemented are Johnson Lindenstrauss, Fast Johnson Lindenstrauss, PCA (in the form of a linear autoencoder), and Non-linear Autoencoders. 

Various experiments are implemented and their results are presented in the paper (Will be added soon).
Experiments test for construction time, reduction time, pairwise distance preservation, and classification/regression scores.
